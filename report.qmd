# Introduction

Our final project aims to explore intricate relationships among key economic indicators across different income groups worldwide. Using data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database, our analysis focuses on three principal economic metrics: GDP per capita, annual GDP growth, and the employment-to-population ratio. By examining these indicators, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can inform economic strategies tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities faced by countries at various stages of economic development.

## Background

Economic indicators are vital tools for assessing the economic performance of countries. They not only reflect the economic health of a nation but also guide policy decisions and investment strategies. In this analysis, we aim to understand how these indicators vary across countries classified into different income groups: high-income, upper-middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income countries. These distinctions are crucial as they often dictate the economic priorities and policy interventions that are most effective for each group.

Economic development is a multifaceted process influenced by a myriad of factors ranging from geopolitical stability and regulatory frameworks to access to technology and the quality of human capital. The interplay between these factors and economic outcomes can be complex and is often mediated by the specific socio-economic context of each country. For instance, high-income countries typically exhibit stable economic growth and high levels of GDP per capita but may face challenges such as aging populations and environmental sustainability. Conversely, low-income countries often struggle with high levels of poverty and underemployment, despite sometimes experiencing rapid economic growth.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) provide a comprehensive dataset that allows for an in-depth analysis of these issues. The WDI compiles statistically rigorous data that spans decades, offering a longitudinal perspective on economic development. This rich dataset enables researchers to trace the trajectories of economic indicators across time and evaluate the impact of economic policies and external shocks on different income groups. By leveraging this data, our project seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on global economic inequality and development, offering insights that could help shape more effective and equitable economic policies.

Through this analysis, we not only explore the current state of global economic health but also aim to forecast future trends. Understanding these trends is essential for policymakers, economists, and international organizations striving to promote sustainable development and reduce economic disparities worldwide. By identifying the key drivers of economic success and the challenges that hinder progress, this project will provide valuable guidance for crafting strategies that enhance economic stability and prosperity for all income groups.

## Research Questions

Our final project revolves around two main questions:
1. How do GDP growth rates differ across all income groups?
2. Does a higher employment-to-population ratio always correlate with higher GDP per capita in low-income countries?


## Objectives

Our objectives of this project are to:
- Analyze the trends and disparities in GDP growth, GDP per capita, and employment ratios across different income groups.
- Explore the potential correlations between high employment rates and GDP per capita in the context of low-income countries.
- Provide insights that could assist in the formulation of economic policies tailored to specific income groups.

## Data and Methods

Our analysis uses comprehensive datasets from the World Bank spaning from 1960 to 2023, providing a strong base for longitudinal analysis.

## Interpretation of Results

- The analysis of GDP growth by income group revealed significant volatility in growth rates, with high-income countries generally experiencing more stable growth.
- Employment to population ratios showed varying trends, where high-income groups maintained relatively stable employment levels, whereas low and lower-middle-income groups displayed more fluctuation.
- The correlation analysis provided insights into how employment levels are associated with economic output per capita, highlighting that higher employment ratios do not always correlate with higher GDP per capita in low-income countries.


# Results and Discussion

This section discusses the results from our analysis. We discuss these findings in light of economic theories, historical context, and potential policy implications.

## Key Findings

### GDP Growth Variability by Income Group

- **Observations**: The analysis reveals significant fluctuations in GDP growth across all income groups. Notably, high-income countries showed more stable growth trajectories compared to more volatile growth patterns in low and lower-middle-income groups.
- **Figure Reference**: Refer to the "Average GDP Growth by Income Group (1960-2023)" plot.
- **Discussion**: The stability in high-income countries can be attributed to their diversified economies and stronger institutional frameworks, which buffer against economic shocks. Conversely, the volatility observed in lower-income groups may result from their greater reliance on primary industries, which are more susceptible to external shocks and market fluctuations.

### Trends in Employment to Population Ratio

- **Observations**: There was a notable decline in the employment-to-population ratio in low-income groups until the early 2000s, followed by a gradual recovery. High-income countries maintained a relatively stable employment ratio.
- **Figure Reference**: Refer to the "Trend of Employment to Population Ratio by Income Group (1990-2023)" plot.
- **Discussion**: The trends in employment ratios highlight the impact of economic policies and global economic conditions on employment levels. The recovery in low-income countries could be linked to increased industrialization and investment in human capital.

### Correlation Between GDP Per Capita and Employment Ratios

- **Observations**: While higher GDP per capita generally correlates with higher employment ratios in high-income countries, this trend is less pronounced in low-income countries.
- **Figure Reference**: Statistical analysis detailed in the "Income Group Correlation Table".
- **Discussion**: This indicates that simply increasing GDP per capita does not automatically lead to higher employment rates in less developed economies. Factors such as labor market structure, social policies, and the nature of economic growth play significant roles.

## Implications

- **Economic Policy**: These findings suggest that policymakers in low-income countries should not solely focus on GDP growth but also on creating quality jobs that reflect economic advancements. Additionally, diversifying the economy can reduce vulnerability to economic shocks and stabilize growth.
- **Future Research**: Further studies could explore the specific sectors within these economies that are most conducive to simultaneous growth in GDP and employment, particularly focusing on technology and service sectors.
- **Global Economic Stability**: Understanding the dynamics between GDP and employment across different income groups is crucial for global economic stability, especially as it pertains to international trade, investment flows, and economic aid strategies.

## Limitations

- **Data Limitations**: Despite rigorous data preprocessing, discrepancies in data reporting and availability across countries and years may affect the robustness of the findings.
- **Scope of Analysis**: While this analysis provides a broad overview, it does not account for intra-group disparities that may offer additional insights into economic conditions.


# Conclusion

Our analysis of economic indicators across different income groups has provided significant insights into the dynamics of GDP growth, GDP per capita, and employment-to-population ratios from 1960 to 2023. Here we list the major findings and propose future directions for research and policy development.

## Major Insights

- **GDP Growth Stability**: High-income countries exhibit more stable GDP growth compared to the more volatile growth seen in lower income groups. This stability is crucial for long-term economic planning and sustainability.
- **Employment Trends**: The employment-to-population ratio shows varying trends across income groups, with high-income countries maintaining more stable employment rates. The fluctuations in low-income groups highlight the need for policies that enhance job security and employment opportunities.
- **Correlation Analysis**: The relationship between GDP per capita and employment ratios varies across income groups. In high-income countries, a strong positive correlation exists, whereas in low-income countries, the correlation is weaker, suggesting that economic growth does not automatically translate into employment growth.

## Implications for Policy

The findings underscore the importance of diversified economic strategies that go beyond focusing solely on GDP growth. For low-income countries, policies aimed at improving education, infrastructure, and technological adoption could spur economic development and enhance employment rates. Additionally, the results advocate for the stability and resilience of economic systems to better withstand global economic shocks.

## Future Research

- **Sector-Specific Analysis**: Future studies could analyze the impact of different economic sectors on GDP and employment to identify which sectors contribute most to sustainable growth.
- **Policy Impact Studies**: Research assessing the effectiveness of specific economic policies on improving GDP and employment figures would provide valuable feedback for policymakers.
